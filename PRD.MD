# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for HyperSecure Messenger

## 1. Product Overview
**Product Name**: HyperSecure Messenger  
**Vision**: To create the world’s most secure and private messaging platform, surpassing existing benchmarks like Threema by integrating state-of-the-art cryptography, full decentralization, and uncompromising anonymity, while maintaining usability for individuals and organizations.  
**Target Audience**: Privacy enthusiasts, security professionals, organizations handling sensitive data (e.g., journalists, legal firms, governments), and privacy-conscious consumers.  
**Release Date**: Q3 2026 (tentative)  
**Current Date**: March 15, 2025  

## 2. Objectives
- Achieve unmatched security through perfect forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and quantum-resistant encryption.
- Eliminate all single points of trust by using a decentralized architecture.
- Ensure zero metadata leakage, even under advanced network surveillance.
- Maintain a seamless, intuitive user experience comparable to mainstream messengers.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Cryptographic Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Use double-ratchet algorithm (as in Signal) enhanced with post-quantum cryptography (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber) for all messages, calls, and file transfers.
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Ensure each session uses unique ephemeral keys that expire after use, preventing decryption of past messages if a key is compromised.
- **Post-Compromise Security (PCS)**: Implement key refreshing mechanisms so compromised devices can regain security after an attack ends.
- **Zero-Knowledge Authentication**: Use zero-knowledge proofs (e.g., ZK-SNARKs) to verify users without exposing identity or keys.

### 3.2 Decentralized Architecture
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Messaging**: Route messages directly between users via a Tor-like onion routing network, bypassing central servers. Fallback to distributed nodes only when direct P2P isn’t possible.
- **Distributed Key Directory**: Replace Threema’s server-based key distribution with a blockchain-inspired, tamper-proof public key ledger maintained by a network of user-run nodes.
- **Self-Hosting Option**: Allow organizations to deploy their own nodes, ensuring full control over their infrastructure.

### 3.3 Privacy and Anonymity
- **No Identifiers Required**: Generate random, ephemeral user IDs with no link to phone numbers, emails, or real-world identities (unlike Threema’s optional linkage).
- **Metadata Obfuscation**: Use mixnets or onion routing to hide sender/receiver IP addresses and message timing from network observers.
- **Self-Destructing Messages**: Default all messages to expire after a user-defined period (e.g., 24 hours), with cryptographic guarantees of deletion.

### 3.4 Usability Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, with real-time sync across devices via secure key exchange.
- **Group Chats and Calls**: Support up to 500 participants with E2E-encrypted voice/video calls, using peer-to-peer connections where possible.
- **File Sharing**: Securely send files up to 100 MB with encryption and optional expiration.
- **QR Code Verification**: Allow in-person contact verification via QR codes to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3.5 Transparency and Auditability
- **Fully Open-Source**: Release all client, server, and node code under a permissive license (e.g., MIT), with a public bug bounty program.
- **Formal Verification**: Subject cryptographic protocols to formal mathematical proofs of security, published for peer review.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct third-party security audits biannually, with results made public.

## 4. Technical Requirements
- **Encryption Libraries**: Leverage libsodium (for NaCl compatibility with Threema) and integrate post-quantum algorithms from NIST’s PQC project.
- **Network Protocol**: Custom P2P protocol with mixnet integration, built on existing frameworks like libp2p or Tor.
- **Storage**: Store all data (messages, keys) locally on devices with AES-256 encryption; no server-side persistence beyond transient routing.
- **Performance**: Support 10 million concurrent users with <1-second message delivery latency under normal conditions.
- **Compatibility**: IPv6-ready and resilient to network disruptions (e.g., via store-and-forward for offline users).

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities found in initial audits; withstand simulated attacks by nation-state actors.
- **Adoption**: 1 million active users within 12 months of launch; 5,000 enterprise clients within 18 months.
- **Privacy**: No metadata leaks detected in independent network analysis.
- **Usability**: 4.5/5 average user rating on app stores for ease of use.

## 6. Risks and Mitigations
- **Complexity**: Advanced cryptography and decentralization may overwhelm users. *Mitigation*: Provide a simple onboarding tutorial and optional "basic mode."
- **Performance**: P2P routing could introduce latency. *Mitigation*: Optimize node selection and caching; offer hybrid routing as a fallback.
- **Adoption**: High security might deter casual users. *Mitigation*: Market as a premium privacy tool with a one-time fee (e.g., $5) or freemium model.

## 7. Timeline
- **Q2 2025**: Finalize protocol design and begin cryptographic implementation.
- **Q4 2025**: Alpha release with P2P messaging and basic encryption; start formal verification.
- **Q2 2026**: Beta release with full feature set; conduct first security audit.
- **Q3 2026**: Public launch with audited, stable version.

## 8. Stakeholders
- **Product Manager**: Oversees vision and roadmap.
- **Cryptography Team**: Designs and verifies protocols.
- **Engineering Team**: Builds client apps and network infrastructure.
- **Security Auditors**: External experts to validate security claims.
- **Users**: Privacy advocates and organizations providing feedback.

## Conclusion
HyperSecure Messenger aims to outstrip Threema by combining cutting-edge cryptography, full decentralization, and absolute anonymity into a usable package. Implementation will require significant resources and expertise, but the result could redefine secure communication.
