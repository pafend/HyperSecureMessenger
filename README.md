## A Declaration of Digital Independence

HyperSecure is not a product. It is a blueprint for true digital sovereignty—a technical manifesto made real through code. In a world where "secure" messaging has been co-opted and compromised, HyperSecure represents the conceptual framework for those who demand absolute security and privacy without compromise.

This repository contains the foundational architecture for what will become your own sovereign communications system, built by you, for you, answerable to no one but you.

### Build It Yourself or Not At All

**This software is not distributed. It is not a service. It will never be shipped.**

HyperSecure is designed to be built, configured, and deployed exclusively by the end user. There are no central servers, no company, no support team—only the architecture and the code that you compile and control completely.

### Uncompromising Design Principles

- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Mathematical security that withstands attacks from both classical and quantum computers
- **Zero Metadata Trail**: No permanent records of who communicated with whom
- **Decentralized Trust**: No central authority, no backdoors, no "master keys"
- **Anti-Forensic By Design**: Leaves no digital artifacts on device storage
- **Human-Layer Security**: Protects against the most overlooked attack vector—coercion of the human user

## Technical Sovereignty Features

The architecture enables (when fully implemented):

- **Neural Typing Obfuscation**: Mask your typing pattern to defeat biometric identification
- **Optical Security Layer**: Prevent screen surveillance, recording, and capturing
- **Memory-Only Operation**: Critical data exists only in encrypted RAM, never touching permanent storage
- **Dead Drop Messaging**: Communication without direct contact between parties
- **Counter-Surveillance Features**: Detect and neutralize monitoring attempts

## How To Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hypersecure/messenger.git
   cd messenger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```

   Note: We use `--ignore-scripts` to prevent native module compilation issues. In a production environment, you would want to properly compile all native dependencies.

3. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a P2P node that:
   - Initializes cryptographic subsystems
   - Sets up a P2P node with a unique ID
   - Simulates message reception for testing

4. For development:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configuration

The application uses a `node-config.json` file for configuration. If this file doesn't exist, a default configuration will be created automatically.

Key configuration options:
- `listenPort`: Port to listen on (0 means pick an available port)
- `listenAddress`: Address to bind to
- `useOnionRouting`: Whether to use onion routing for metadata protection
- `routingHops`: Number of hops for onion routing
- `discoveryMethod`: How to discover peers (`manual`, `local-network`, or `dht`)
- `enableMesh`: Whether to enable mesh networking
- `knownPeers`: List of known peers to connect to

## How To Proceed

1. **Fork and build**: This is your foundation. Fork it, customize it, own it.
2. **Study the architecture**: Understand every component before deploying it.
3. **Implement incrementally**: Follow the [TODO.md](TODO.md) roadmap, building each component with care.
4. **Test rigorously**: Verify the security of your implementation at every step.
5. **Deploy privately**: Set up your own node infrastructure, controlled only by you.

## Critical Notice: Legal & Ethical Responsibility

**By accessing this code, you accept full responsibility for your use of it.**

HyperSecure deliberately implements maximum-strength privacy and security features that **may not comply with legal requirements in your jurisdiction**. This may include:

- Laws requiring encryption backdoors
- Mandatory key escrow
- Data retention requirements
- Surveillance compliance obligations
- Anti-privacy regulations

The authors make no claims, promises, or guarantees about the legality of building, deploying, or using this system, and explicitly disclaim any responsibility for how you choose to use this architecture.

**You alone must determine whether building and using this system complies with the laws applicable to you.**

## For Whom Is This Intended?

- Those for whom privacy is a fundamental right worth defending
- Those who believe ownership of your communications should be absolute
- Those in need of protection from surveillance and targeted compromise
- Those who understand that true security comes only from systems you fully control

## Technical Foundation

The architecture incorporates:

- **Triple-Layer Encryption**: Three independent cryptographic systems for message contents, metadata, and routing
- **Formal Mathematical Security**: Designs based on provable security properties
- **Post-Quantum Primitives**: Cryptographic implementations that resist quantum attack vectors
- **Zero-Knowledge Protocols**: Authentication without revealing identity
- **Mesh Networking Capability**: Routing without centralized infrastructure

## Development Approach

This is a sovereign system. The development path follows these principles:

1. **Understand everything**: No code goes into your implementation without your comprehension
2. **Trust no dependencies**: Review all libraries and external code thoroughly
3. **Verify mathematically**: Use formal verification where possible
4. **Test adversarially**: Assume sophisticated attackers with unlimited resources
5. **Deploy minimally**: The smallest possible attack surface is the goal
