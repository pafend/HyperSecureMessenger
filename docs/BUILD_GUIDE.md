# HyperSecure Messenger DIY Build Guide

This document guides you through building your own sovereign instance of HyperSecure Messenger. By following this guide, you'll create a system that you fully control and understand.

## Important Principles

Before proceeding:

1. **Verify everything yourself**: Don't trust code you haven't verified
2. **Understand before implementing**: Only implement features you fully comprehend
3. **Build incrementally**: Start with a minimal system and gradually add features
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify security at each stage
5. **Maintain sovereignty**: Never rely on central servers or services

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge Requirements
- Familiarity with TypeScript/JavaScript
- Understanding of cryptographic principles
- Knowledge of P2P networking concepts
- Basic understanding of Electron (for desktop) or React Native (for mobile)

### System Requirements

#### Development Environment
- A secure, dedicated development machine
- Up-to-date operating system with security patches applied
- Encrypted storage for all development work
- Disabled cloud synchronization services
- Dedicated firewall with strict rules

#### Software Requirements
- Node.js v18+ (verified from official sources)
- Git (for version control)
- Build tools appropriate for your platform:
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - Linux: build-essential, gcc, g++

## Step 1: Secure Your Development Environment

Before you start building:

1. **Create an isolated development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create a dedicated user for development if possible
   sudo useradd -m hypersecure-dev  # On Linux
   # Or use a virtual machine with encrypted storage
   ```

2. **Set up an encrypted development directory**:
   ```bash
   # Example using VeraCrypt or similar tool
   # Create an encrypted volume for your development work
   ```

3. **Disable telemetry in your development tools**:
   ```bash
   # Example for VS Code
   # Edit settings.json to disable telemetry
   ```

4. **Configure strict firewall rules**:
   ```bash
   # Allow only necessary outbound connections
   # Block all unnecessary inbound connections
   ```

## Step 2: Obtain the Source Code

Clone the repository (or download archive if you prefer):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hypersecure/messenger.git

# Verify the integrity of the code
# Check commit signatures or compare hashes
```

## Step 3: Review the Code

Before building, review the code for security issues and backdoors:

```bash
# Use static analysis tools
npm install -g eslint
eslint .

# Review critical security components manually
# Focus on cryptographic implementations and network code
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install required dependencies after reviewing them:

```bash
# Install dependencies (after reviewing each one)
npm install

# Alternatively, install dependencies one by one after reviewing each:
npm install libsodium-wrappers-sumo
npm install hyperswarm
# etc.
```

## Step 5: Configure Your Build

Create a personal configuration file:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp config.example.json config.json

# Edit the configuration for your needs
# Ensure all default settings are security-focused
```

Key configuration options to consider:
- Set `memoryOnly: true` for enhanced security
- Configure `routingHops: 3` (or higher) for better anonymity
- Set `discoveryMethod: "manual"` to prevent automatic connections
- Enable `secureDelete: true` for anti-forensic features

## Step 6: Build the Core Components

Build the cryptographic and network components first:

```bash
# Build with strict TypeScript settings
npm run build

# Verify the build artifacts
# Check for unexpected files or code
```

## Step 7: Test Security Components

Test the security of your build:

```bash
# Run cryptographic tests
npm run crypto:test

# Run security verification
npm run audit:sec
```

## Step 8: Build Desktop Client

For a desktop implementation:

```bash
# Build the Electron app
npm run electron:build

# Create a portable build
npm run package
```

Electron security considerations:
- Review the preload script for secure boundaries
- Ensure contextIsolation is enabled
- Verify that nodeIntegration is disabled
- Check that remote content is properly secured

## Step 9: Build Mobile Client (Optional)

For a mobile implementation (requires additional setup):

```bash
# Navigate to mobile directory
cd src/client/mobile

# Install mobile dependencies
npm install

# Build for Android
npm run android:build

# Build for iOS (macOS only)
npm run ios:build
```

Mobile security considerations:
- Ensure app permissions are minimal
- Review native code for security issues
- Implement secure storage on the device

## Step 10: Verify Your Build

Before using your build:

```bash
# Check for unexpected network connections
# Use tools like Wireshark or tcpdump

# Verify binary integrity
# Check file hashes and examine binary contents

# Scan for security issues
# Use security scanning tools specific to your platform
```

## Step 11: Secure Deployment

Deploy your build securely:

1. **Create secure installation media**:
   ```bash
   # Write to encrypted USB drive
   # Or use other secure distribution methods
   ```

2. **Verify installation integrity**:
   ```bash
   # Verify hashes after installation
   # Check for tampering during installation
   ```

3. **Configure secure runtime environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set up appropriate permissions
   # Configure firewall rules
   # Enable disk encryption
   ```

## Step 12: Key and Identity Creation

Generate your cryptographic identity:

```bash
# Run the application with identity creation flag
./hypersecure-messenger --create-identity

# Securely back up your keys
# Consider hardware-based backup options
```

## Step 13: Connect to Peers

Connect to trusted peers:

```bash
# Manually add peers using their public keys
# Exchange keys through secure out-of-band channels
# Verify peer identities through secondary channels
```

## Step 14: Secure Usage

Once built and deployed:

1. **Regular security updates**:
   ```bash
   # Keep dependencies updated after review
   # Apply security patches quickly
   ```

2. **Regular verification**:
   ```bash
   # Periodically verify application integrity
   # Check for unexpected changes or behavior
   ```

3. **Secure key management**:
   ```bash
   # Rotate keys periodically
   # Verify key integrity
   ```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows

```powershell
# Install build tools
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

# Enable security features
# Configure Windows Defender Application Guard
# Enable memory integrity in Windows Security
```

### macOS

```bash
# Install build tools
xcode-select --install

# Enable security features
# Turn on FileVault
# Configure Gatekeeper appropriately
```

### Linux

```bash
# Install build tools
sudo apt-get install build-essential
# or
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

# Configure AppArmor or SELinux profiles
# Set up restrictive permissions
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Build failures**:
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify your development environment setup

2. **Runtime errors**:
   - Check configuration settings
   - Verify cryptographic implementations
   - Debug P2P connectivity issues

3. **Security concerns**:
   - Review the relevant code sections
   - Consult the security guide
   - Implement additional protections as needed

## Final Verification

Before regular use:

1. **Conduct a thorough security review**
2. **Test all critical functionality**
3. **Verify network security with monitoring tools**
4. **Ensure anti-forensic features work correctly**
5. **Test under adversarial conditions**

## Conclusion

By building HyperSecure Messenger yourself, you've created a system you can trust because you understand and control every aspect of it. Maintain vigilance by regularly reviewing and updating your implementation, and always prioritize security over convenience.

Remember: True security comes from understanding, not blind trust.
